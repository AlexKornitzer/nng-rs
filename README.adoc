This repository is a wrapper for https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/[nng (Nanomsg-next-generation)].
See the subdirectories for the individual crates for more information.
The goal is to make this compatible with Rust 2018 but making this compatible with Rust 2015 (rustc v1.0) is a possibility if there is a desire.

This crate is meant to maintain an API that is similar to the original C library in order to make transitioning to and from other NNG wrappers easier.
As such, it does not attempt to utilize crates like https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.25/futures/[futures] or https://tokio.rs/[Tokio] and there are no plans to support https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50547[async/await].
If those features are appealing, https://crates.io/crates/runng[Runng] is an alternate wrapper that may be more appropriate.
