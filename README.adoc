This repository is a wrapper for https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/[nng (Nanomsg-next-generation)].
See the subdirectories for the individual crates for more information.
The goal is to make this compatible with Rust 2018 but making this compatible with Rust 2015 (rustc v1.0) is a possibility if there is a desire.
